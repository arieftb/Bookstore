Here a list of tasks you could do:

1. Need a message to pop up after user fills up the shipping details form. The message could be of the form, 'Thanks for making a purchase, you may find all the details in your email'

2. Add validation to the form in books.html

3. Make the navbar a little better.

4. If you think the pages are too blank, add some impressive backgrounds to it. If you are adding any images, make sure it is not a copyrighted one. Choose the images from unsplash.com or freepik.com or any other equivalent platform.
