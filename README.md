A frontend design for a Bookstore by Notesflix. Implemented with HTML and CSS.
# New here? No idea what to contribute to this project?
Here a list of tasks you could do:
1. Add a search bar in index.html
2. Do the navigation bar a little better
3. Make sure the website is reponsive
4. If you think the pages are too blank, add some impressive backgrounds to it. If you are adding any images, make sure it is not a copyrighted one. Choose the images from unsplash.com or freepik.com or any other equivalent platform.
5. Add validation to the form in books.html
6. Need a message to pop up after user fills up the shipping details form. The message could be of the form, 'Thanks for making a purchase, you may find all the details in your email'
